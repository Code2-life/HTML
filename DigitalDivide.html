The internet has become a daily 
necessacity in the present day. 
Its become so essential that people say 
they even have a natural right to the Internet. 
In this Internet-driven world, there are some people 
who may not be able access high-speed and reliable Internet. <br><br>This results in a information/resource gap between groups able to access high-speed Internet and groups who can't. This is termed <strong>The Digital Divide.</strong>
<br>

Fortunately, a solution to the problem is quite simple. By targeting the main causes of the digital divide through 
a precisely crafted government policy, The Digital Divide can be stopped once and for all(in the country).

<br>
<br>
<br>
A concept of a policy that can ideally stop and prevent The Digital Divide from occuring is as follows:<br>
<br>
<underline><span><b>Digital Divide Policy: </b></b></span><br><br> To combat the on-going issue of Digital Divide, the Federal Government can issue sufficiently funded mandates that require states to build and develop Internet infrastructure 
    in the rural/remote areas 
    (or any areas being affected by the dilemma). 
    The Central Government will also be 
    willing to give subsidies to non-profits
     or businesses that aim to help the disabled
      use Internet resources.</underline>
    <br><br><br>
    As with everthing, there are pros and cons to this policy as well.
    <br><br><br>
    <span><B>PROS</B></span><br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Immediate affect</b> - States are usually quick to act on mandated grants given by the Federal Government, this will ensure
            that the process of elimination of Digital Divide will start quicker
        </li><br><br>
        <li> <b>Development</b> - Can cause businesses regarding this issue to rise (due to subsidies) which will increase awareness of this issue and contribute in its prevention
        </li><br><br>
        <li> <b>Increased support from people</b> - Due to the government bringing into light an Internet Dilemma and solving it, the public is more likely to vote for the same party/condidates again.
        </li><br><br>
        <li> <b>Focus on similar related/unrelated problems in remote/rural areas</b> - The policy involves the state government in surveying each area in its jurisdiction, this gives the State government a clearer picture of the problems in ALL areas. This can lead to programs created to solve problems that once were never even known to the public.</li>
    </ol><br><br><br>
    <span><b>CONS</b></span><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Funding</b> - The Federal Government has budgets which it cannot cross. In the case when the mandated grant funds exceed this limit, the States will have to pay the expenses on their own. This may discourage some States. 
        </li> <br> <br> <br>
        <li> <b>Capitalistic businesses</b> - businesses which are founded for the subisdies of the government and infact do nothing to contribute to the cause of prevention of the Digital Divide. They may not reach the most disabled groups and instead reachout to a general group.        
        </li><br><br><br>
        <li> 
        <b>Maintenance of Infratructure</b> - While developing and building infrastructure is one thing, maintaining this infrastructure would be a whole another issue of its own. The areas which these infratructures are built may not generate enough revenue and the federal government 
            has to keep a constant flow of funds for the States to maintain them.
        </li><br><br><br>
        <li> 
        <b>Coordination</b> - Each state may have its own interpretation of "Preventing the Digital Divide", this may lead to problems in the coordinated efforts the policy wants to have. Although this problem is not as bad as the others, it is still an inconvience for the National Government and the State Governemnts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br>

    Hence, to resolve the critical Internet dilemma, The Digital Divide, the proposed policy is one of the best and easiest ways to accomplish this.<br><br>For more information, click the sources below.
